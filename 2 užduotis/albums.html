    <p>"Dogrel" (2019) is the debut album of Fontaines D.C. The Dublin natives debut is 
    quite typical of young bands that employ the usual instruments of electric, bass <br>
    guitars, drums and having inspirations from post-punk and rock genres - heavy 
    distortion, messy and loud this brash album might not be the thing that instantly <br>
    catches a listeners attention. Regardless of this uninspiring intro there is still 
    a lot to love here - the first 2 tracks on the album, "Big" and "Sha Sha Sha", should <br>
    give enough hope to give a chance for their second album - "A Hero's Death".   </p>

    <p>"A Hero's Death" (2020) - is the second album of Fontaines D.C. and truly the 
    fulfillment of the promise that "Dogrel" made - the band members' love of poetry, <br>
    ability to harmonize with each other, reduction of the messier aspects of their first 
    album come together to give lovers of the post-punk and other similar genres an album <br>
    that could have easily been their favorite from the year 2020. The first track ("Don't Belong")
    already sounds more like sung poetry, highly disorienting if you thought you were listening  <br>
    to the other, more aggressive bands in the punk genre. This album has much variation, poetic 
    (at least most of the time) lyrics and it is quite nice that the band didn't waste their time <br>
    during the restricting and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19"> catastrophic year of 2020</a> 
    by releasing isolation versions of their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6df9xZzhnjk">songs</a> . </p>
